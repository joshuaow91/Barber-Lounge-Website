# How It's Made: 

## Tech used: HTML, CSS & JavaScript(Single Function for Menu on mobile devices)

This website was created using a combination of Flexbox CSS and media queries to ensure it is optimized for all devices, from desktops to smartphones.

Flexbox CSS is a powerful tool for designing layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. It allows you to create flexible and responsive containers, which can be customized to fit any screen size. This means that the website's layout can be easily adjusted based on the size of the device, ensuring that the content is always displayed in the most optimal way.

In addition to Flexbox, media queries were also used to optimize the website's appearance for different devices. Media queries allow you to define different CSS styles for different screen sizes, making it easy to customize the website's layout for mobile devices or desktop screens.

## Optimizations

When I have more time to I would like to go back and fix some of the aesethics within the content of the page. Incorporate a user portal with the ability to book appointments and have access to past appointment info. Incorporate a POS to complete transactions prior to visiting the shop.

## Lessons Learned:

-Keep it Simple: One of the key lessons learned was the importance of simplicity. By keeping the website's design and functionality simple, it was easier to create, test, and maintain. This also ensured that the website was easy to use and understand for visitors.

-Test, Test, Test: Testing is critical for any web development project. By testing the website thoroughly, it was easier to identify and fix bugs and ensure that the website was accessible and user-friendly.

-Keep Learning: Finally, web development is a constantly evolving field, and it's important to keep learning and staying up to date with the latest trends and techniques. This ensures that the website is optimized for the best user experience, and that the development team continues to improve and grow their skills.
